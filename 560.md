### Leetcode 560:

Given a array nums, find numbers of subsequences summing up to a given constant k.

Example:

nums = [1,1,-1] k = 2

Answer = 1



### Solution:

* Suppose we have are adding up the $i_{th}$ item to the sum of the array

* Sum of any subsequence could be given as 

$$Sum_{subsequence} = num[j+1]+num[j+2]...num[i] (i>j)$$

* Define running sum as num[0]+num[1]…+num[i]

$$Sum_{running} = num[0]+num[1]...num[i] $$

* Substracting two sums, we get (j could be any number 0<=j<i, so we called it history sum)

$$Sum_{history} = num[0]+num[1]...num[j] $$

* Sum_his + Sum_sub = Sum_running
* Since Sum_sub = k, Sum_running = sum, Sum_his = sum-k
* （#Sum_his = sum-k） == （#Sum_sub = k）

```python
#input: nums, k
#return: cnt
#Time Complexity: O(n)
#Space Complexity: O(n)
    def subarraySum(self, nums, k):
        sumOccur = dict({0: 1})
        sum = 0
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(0, len(nums)):
            sum += nums[i]
            if sum not in sumOccur:
                sumOccur[sum] = 0
            if (sum-k) in sumOccur:
                cnt += sumOccur[sum-k]
            sumOccur[sum] += 1

        return cnt

```
